After contemplating it for a **while**, I finally decided to update my personal website. I finally bought a domain and started to research different options to build this new website in. After some deliberation, I ended up choosing **NextJS**. 

I chose **NextJS** not only for its stellar performance and hence, its great SEO, but also, for its ease of development and support for advanced features like dynamic page routing.
